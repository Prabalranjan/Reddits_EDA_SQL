In this project i learned that we can use SQL with python. i am so impressed that we can so that with the help of PANDASQL.sqldf 
if you dont have pandasql installed than install it.
on anaconda promt: 
                  PIP INSTALL PANDASQL  



One of the most exciting thing of this project is WORLDCLOUD. we can create word visualization with this package of python.

 you will get to know when you will do it yourself.
